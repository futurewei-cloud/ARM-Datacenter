## Mission statement  

There are common use cases in High Performance Computing (HPC) where a user space scheduler and a user space lightweight thread model work together to handle massively concurrent workloads.

Enterprise storage systems are designed to handle massively concurrent I/O workloads.  The open source community currently does not have any project dedicated to handling this type of I/O workload.  Our project will produce a lightweight thread and scheduling framework, which is consumable as a library/runtime, and will be suitable for Enterprise storage I/O workloads.

For more information about this effort, please check out this [blog](../Argobots-Runtime-storage)
