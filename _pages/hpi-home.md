The focus of this initiative is to research software development and distribution models for **Heterogenous Systems**.  
A Heterogeneous System consists of multiple single and/or multicore processors of different types. 
The simple example of Heterogeneous System may be the combination of a multicore processor with a GPU.

Large variety of hardware accelerators and system configurations present significant challenge for software development and distribution.

In our research we will evaluate feasibility of using Intermediate Representation (**IR**) code to abstract hardware specific details.
This will allow code generation and distribution to large variety of Heterogenous Systems.
